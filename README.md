## Technical Details

### Smile Detection Algorithm

The app uses facial landmarks to detect smiles by:
- Analyzing mouth corner positions relative to the mouth center
- Calculating the mouth width-to-height aspect ratio
- Detecting upward movement of mouth corners
- Applying thresholds to avoid false positives

### Key Landmarks Used
- Point 1: Nose tip (face center reference)
- Points 61, 291: Left and right mouth corners
- Points 13, 14: Upper and lower lip centers

### Dependencies

- MediaPipe Face Mesh for facial landmark detection
- MediaPipe Face Detection for face detection
- MediaPipe Camera Utils for camera handling

## Browser Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebRTC support
- Camera access permission
- JavaScript enabled

## Development

To run locally:
1. Serve the files using a local web server (required for camera access)
2. For example: `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx serve`
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Customization

You can easily customize:
- Emoji selection in the `drawEmoji()` method
- Smile detection sensitivity by adjusting thresholds
- Animation styles in `styles.css`
- UI colors and layout

## Privacy

- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
